# Aura

Aura is an AI V-tuber written in python and uses Neo-GPT as the model using an API. It can speak and talk using Microsofts TTS and STT API.

It has image recognition using some sort of random model that I forgot.

Want to download it to try?
I might put it on my Github (@jaxfry) in the future. As of now, their is no download as I am too lazy. If people actually want this let me know on discord.

APIs are helpful!
