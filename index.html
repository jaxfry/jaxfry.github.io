        I'm JaxFry, a coder with a basic understanding of some languages such as Python, Java, Javascript, and HTML/CSS. I'm also a student at a high school in Canada. I'm almost always working on a few projects but if you have any ideas, feel free to reach out to me! I'm not only interested in coding, but I also enjoy playing video games, watching anime, and many other things.
