        <h2>#1 - Getting Started With Variables and VS Code</h2>

        <h3>Downloads</h3>
        <p>To get started, you need a code editor. We recommend downloading Visual Studio Code.</p>
        <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=stable&os=win32-arm64-user" class="btn btn-primary">Download VS Code</a>
        <p style="font-size: small; color: red;">If the download link is not working <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">click here</a>.</p>


        <h3>Intermediate Mini-Challenge</h3>
        <p>Background:
            Caesar`s cipher is a basic encryption method where each character in the plaintext is replaced by another character a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
            
            For example, using a right shift of 3, A would become D, B would become E, and so on.
        </p>
        <img src="{{ 'pages/club/images/cipher.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Caesar Cipher" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px; margin: 0 auto; display: block;">

        <p>Task:
            Write a Python program to decode the following message: “O rubk vxumxgssotm ayotm Veznut”, knowing that the key (shift) is 6.
            We are using “abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz” (Just the alphabet, no characters)
        </p>

        <h4>Starter Code</h4>
        <pre>
        <code>
            ciphertext = "O rubk vxumxgssotm ayotm Veznut"

            def decrypt(ciphertext, key):
                # complete code here
            
            decrypt(ciphertext, 6)
        </code>
        </pre>
        <p>We will cover a solution on the next club day. If you have completed the challenge, feel free to add more features. Eg. encrypt function, cipher brute forcer, be creative! If you are uninterested in the challenge, feel free to work on your own (coding related) project. If you have any suggestions for future mini-challenges, let me know. We will be announcing the people who have completed the challenge on the Discord unless you wish me not to do so.</p>

        <p>Good Luck!</p>
