        <h2>#2 - Introduction to Data Types</h2>

        <h3>Intermediate Mini-Challenge</h3>
        <p>Background: Tamagotchi was a digital pet created in Japan in 1996. Users cared for there tamagotchi by feeding, playing, and cleaning up after them, mimicking owning a real pet! After a while there pet could grow and evolve if it was well taken care of. Tamagotchi was a very popular product all around the globe.</p>

        <p>Task Advanced Version: 
            Create your own version of a Tamagotchi in Python with a text based interface! Include attributes such as happiness and hunger, and be able to play with it. Be creative, expand on from there!

            If you are wanting to expand upon this project, here are some ideas:
            - Add more attributes such as age, weight, and energy
            - Add more activities such as feeding, cleaning, and sleeping
            - Add a GUI interface or ASCII art
            - Add a save feature
            - If you're feeling really ambitious, add a multiplayer feature. Fun fact, Tamagotchi did have a multiplayer feature in later versions then the original!
        </p>

        <p>Task Beginner Version:
            Create a simpler version where users can only feed or play with the pet and see how it effects the pets attributes.
        </p>

        <h4>Starter Code</h4>
        <p>If you wish to use it...</p>

        <p>If you are uninterested in the challenge, feel free to work on your own (coding related) project. If you have any suggestions for future mini-challenges, let me know. We will be announcing the people who have completed the challenge on the Discord unless you wish me not to do so.</p>

        <p>Good Luck!</p>

        <h2>#1 - Getting Started With Variables and VS Code</h2>

        <h3>Downloads</h3>
        <p>To get started, you need a code editor. We recommend downloading Visual Studio Code.</p>
        <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/sha/download?build=stable&os=win32-arm64-user" class="btn btn-primary">Download VS Code</a>
        <p style="font-size: small; color: red;">If the download link is not working <a href="https://code.visualstudio.com/download">click here</a>.</p>


        <h3>Intermediate Mini-Challenge</h3>
        <p>Background:
            Caesar`s cipher is a basic encryption method where each character in the plaintext is replaced by another character a fixed number of positions down the alphabet.
            
            For example, using a right shift of 3, A would become D, B would become E, and so on.
        </p>
        <img src="{{ 'pages/club/images/cipher.png' | relative_url }}" alt="Caesar Cipher" style="width: 100%; max-width: 500px; margin: 0 auto; display: block;">

        <p>Task:
            Write a Python program to decode the following message: “O rubk vxumxgssotm ayotm Veznut”, knowing that the key (shift) is 6.
            We are using “abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz” (Just the alphabet, no characters)
        </p>

        <h4>Starter Code</h4>
        <pre>
        <code>
            ciphertext = "O rubk vxumxgssotm ayotm Veznut"

            def decrypt(ciphertext, key):
                # complete code here
            
            decrypt(ciphertext, 6)
        </code>
        </pre>
        <p>We will cover a solution on the next club day. If you have completed the challenge, feel free to add more features. Eg. encrypt function, cipher brute forcer, be creative! If you are uninterested in the challenge, feel free to work on your own (coding related) project. If you have any suggestions for future mini-challenges, let me know. We will be announcing the people who have completed the challenge on the Discord unless you wish me not to do so.</p>

        <p>Good Luck!</p>
