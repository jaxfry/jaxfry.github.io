title:  "QFH Antenna"
---

**Hello Everyone!** I recently bought a Nooelec RTL-SDR v5, and I've been having a lot of fun playing around it. So far I've listened to some local FM radio stations, tracked overhead aircrafts using ADS-B and ships using AIS with the kit antenna. For the past couple of weeks, I've been working on a QFH antenna for 137.500 MHz. My plan once I'm finished is to use it for listening to the NOAA satellites. I've been following the instructions from [this website](https://www.instructables.com/NOAA-Satellite-Signals-with-a-PVC-QFH-Antenna-and-/) and I'm almost done so I'll post an update once I'm finished.

On another note, I've been learning C++ for fun, and so far it's going well.

Iâ€™ll see you soon, and well, happy Ika Musume (ã‚¤ã‚«å¨˜) day! ðŸ¦‘
